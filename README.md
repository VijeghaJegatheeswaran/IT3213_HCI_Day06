Page 01 - Fixed Navigation Bar üîù

Features
Dynamic Panel Setup:

Icons (Home, Programs, Classes, Videos) grouped into a dynamic panel.

The panel is pinned to the top center of the browser.

Scroll Interaction:

Navbar shows or hides based on the scroll position (Window.scrollY).

How It Works
The navigation bar remains fixed at the top while scrolling.

When scrolling beyond a certain point, the navbar hides or reappears smoothly.
